Big O notation is an equation used to determine run time scales according to various input variables.

For example- imagine we had a basketball court that was 100m x 100 m:


O(a*b) ---> a represents one side of the court, and b represents the other

O(a) ---> area of basketball court

O(s^2) ---> s being one side (100m) of the court
